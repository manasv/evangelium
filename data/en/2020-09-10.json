Even sinners love those who love them.\n[[Lc 6,33]]And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do the same.\n[[Lc 6,34]]If you lend money to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit (is) that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, and get back the same amount.\n[[Lc 6,35]]But rather, love your enemies and do good to them, and lend expecting nothing back; then your reward will be great and you will be children of the Most High, for he himself is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.\n[[Lc 6,36]]Be merciful, just as (also) your Father is merciful.\n[[Lc 6,37]]Stop judging and you will not be judged. Stop condemning and you will not be condemned. Forgive and you will be forgiven.\n[[Lc 6,38]]Give and gifts will be given to you; a good measure, packed together, shaken down, and overflowing, will be poured into your lap.
