Sit down and quickly write one for fifty.'\n[[Lc 16,7]]Then to another he said, 'And you, how much do you owe?' He replied, 'One hundred kors of wheat.' He said to him, 'Here is your promissory note; write one for eighty.'\n[[Lc 16,8]]And the master commended that dishonest steward for acting prudently. \"For the children of this world are more prudent in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.\"\n[[Lc 16,9]]I tell you, make friends for yourselves with dishonest wealth, so that when it fails, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.\n[[Lc 16,10]]The person who is trustworthy in very small matters is also trustworthy in great ones; and the person who is dishonest in very small matters is also dishonest in great ones.\n[[Lc 16,11]]If, therefore, you are not trustworthy with dishonest wealth, who will trust you with true wealth?\n[[Lc 16,12]]If you are not trustworthy with what belongs to another, who will give you what is yours?\n[[Lc 16,13]]No servant can serve two masters.
