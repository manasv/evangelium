The column of cloud also, leaving the front, took up its place behind them,\n[[Ex 14,20]]so that it came between the camp of the Egyptians and that of Israel. But the cloud now became dark, and thus the night passed without the rival camps coming any closer together all night long.\n[[Ex 14,21]]Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD swept the sea with a strong east wind throughout the night and so turned it into dry land.
